//   - FORGETs every cluster node whose IP is not among the live pod IPs (the lingering
//     trace of a deleted or recreated pod), issuing the FORGET from every live node;
//   - when meetMissing is true, MEETs every live pod not yet in the cluster view (a

//     its slots. It is forgotten and its slots are re-covered with cluster fix.
//   - ephemeral=false (persistent): the recreated pod keeps its PVC, hence its nodes.conf
//     and node ID, and will reclaim those slots on rejoin (or a replica has already failed
//     over). Forgetting and reassigning now would strand its data, so slot-owning stale
//     entries are left untouched and simply waited out. Only slotless stale entries (which
//     hold no data) are forgotten. This mirrors forgetFailedNodes' slot-owner protection.
//
// It returns changed=true if any node was forgotten or met, so callers can requeue and
// re-evaluate from a clean topology; when nothing changed it is a fast no-op.
